## LinkedUp User Guide

**LinkedUp is designed for university student leaders** including club presidents, society executives, event organizers, student council members, and committee heads who manage extensive networks of contacts across campus and beyond. These users typically manage 50-500+ contacts including fellow students, faculty advisors, alumni mentors, corporate sponsors, venue coordinators, and partner organization representatives. **The application assumes users are comfortable with typing and prefer keyboard-based workflows** over mouse-driven interfaces, valuing speed and efficiency in data entry and retrieval. Users are expected to be familiar with basic command syntax similar to using search bars or messaging apps, and need categorization and tagging capabilities to organize contacts by role, project, or affiliation without complex navigation.

**LinkedUp empowers student leaders to organize their professional networks efficiently through fast, typing-based commands.** Instead of clicking through multiple menus, users simply type short commands to add contacts, search for specific people, categorize relationships, and retrieve information instantly. The application displays all contact information, search results, and organized lists visually while letting users work at typing speed, combining the speed of text-based input with the clarity of visual presentation. Whether you're a club president tracking member information, an event organizer managing vendor contacts, or a society executive coordinating with sponsors, **LinkedUp helps you maintain your network without slowing you down**, making it ideal for users who need quick access to their contacts during busy coordination work.

## [Features](#toc)<a name="features"></a>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## [FAQ](#toc) <a name="faq"></a>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Follow all instructions below in order <br>
1. You can use `export f/FILE` to create either a `.csv` file or a `.json` file.
2. Copy your file of choice to your other computer, then use `import f/FILE` to use your data in your other computer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Known issues](#toc) <a name="issues"></a>

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
